It took me a long time to understand the difference between *Free Software* (as defined by GNU) and *Open Source* software.

It really seemed like folks in ivory towers with too much time on their hands arguing about semantics when they should be playing on the same team.

I didn't begin to understand the difference until Google demonstrated it so perfectly with their attitude toward Android.
